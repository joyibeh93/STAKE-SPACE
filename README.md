###It is a website that gives more information about project stake, it is centered around the challenges some of us encounter finding difficult to navigate slack and understand the processes involved due to missed information and also issues some people encounter due to not being able to access slack hereby having issues with following up.

The page is all about giving information on weekly events like office space to quickly get the link and join the meeting and time, Office Hours  to join weekly office hours and also peer meet up, where one can identify their learners in the same learning space.

The project is built using html,css, JavaScript,and bootstrap, including python.
